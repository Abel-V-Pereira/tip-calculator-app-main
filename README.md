## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think I got better at working with forEach and Event Listeners, it's still far from good but it's definitely better than in my past codes XD.

### Continued development

I want to get better at refactoring my code. Sometimes I just can't figure out how to transform my repetitive code into some function that'll do things in a cleaner way. I gotta work harder on that for sure.
